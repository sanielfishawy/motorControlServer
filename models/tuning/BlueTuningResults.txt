Slip vs Frequency for Max Torque
================================

FreqHz < 1
    - Set frequency to 3Hz

1 <= FreqHz <= 18
    SlipFract = -0.022 * FreqHz + 0.62

FreqHz > 18
    SlipFract = 0.26

Torq vs Amplitude By FreqHz
===========================

2Hz -> 6Hz
    Torque = 1.33 * AmpFract - 0.29

6Hz -> 10Hz
    Torque =
